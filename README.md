# CLI for AppWash written in Rust

CLI for the website [appwash.com](https://appwash.com/). Uses the same API.

This projects is going to be the same as [appwash-cli](https://github.com/omfj/appwash-cli), but written in Rust.

## TODO

- Fix command: reserve
- Fix command: stop
- Pretty output: list
- Pretty output: history
- Better error handling
- Manage timezones better
- Store token between command usage

Rust is hard, please give me feedback.
