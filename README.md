# CLI for AppWash written in Rust

CLI for the website [appwash.com](https://appwash.com/). Uses the same API.

This projects is going to be the same as [appwash-cli](https://github.com/omfj/appwash-cli), but written in Rust.

## Install

If you are on Mac and have [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) installed you use the Makefile in the repo.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:omfj/appwash-rs
cd appwash-rs
```

```bash
make all
```

Now the binary should be installed to your system. You can type `appwash` into your terminal emulator and the output should look similar to this:

```bash
âžœ appwash
